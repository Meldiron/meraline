# Changelog

Notable changes in each Meraline release, newest first.

When a version has an entry here, the Release workflow uses it as the release notes on GitHub and in the in-app update window. A version without an entry gets the list of commits since the previous tag instead. Headings are `## vX.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD`.

## v1.1.0 - 2026-09-26

### Ask

- **Apple Intelligence.** The on-device model built into macOS is a provider now: private, works offline, needs no key, and is on by default on Macs that support it, so a fresh install can answer before any key is added. Other providers you set up take precedence over it.
- **Fresh starts.** After the window has been hidden for a while (30 minutes by default, adjustable in Settings › General), the chat moves to Recent Chats and your next question starts fresh.
- **Copy Conversation** (⌥⇧⌘C) copies the whole chat as Markdown.
- Codex can search the web when the toggle on its page is on.
- The Answers pane is now called Prompt, and the Settings window is titled after the pane you're on.

### Install and update

- **A proper installer.** Releases ship as a styled disk image, signed and notarized, alongside the zip. Homebrew users can `brew install --cask meldiron/tap/meraline`.
- **Quiet updates.** Updates download and install in the background. The menu bar menu and Settings › Software Update show when one is ready, and after an update Meraline shows what changed.
- **Beta channel.** Settings › Software Update › Update channel switches to early builds ahead of each release.

### Automate and diagnose

- **`meraline://` URLs.** `meraline://ask?text=…&send=1` asks a question from Shortcuts, Raycast, or a script; `meraline://new` and `meraline://settings` do what they say.
- **Copy Diagnostics** in Settings › About produces a report for bug reports, with no keys, questions, or answers in it.
